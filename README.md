## MDDN 242 2024 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

### Initial Idea:

To delve straight into the meat of this assignment, I started coding on the first possible idea I came up with. Simple, with a lot of space to parameterise.

### Precedent

Coding with p5.js has always slightly reminded me of a flash game I played as a kid, Hoshi Saga; a point-and-click hidden object game with unique and experimental solutions.

Levels start by looking rather unassuming, simplistic. The base goal is to find a star by interaction via clicking or occasionally typing. It would be rather interesting to recreate one of these levels in p5.js, or to eventually create my own.

### Casting Shadows

I started using the p5.js web editor as a separate development environment to clarify my ideas before porting them over to the main files. Truth be told, I am mostly terrified to delete or alter the wrong line of code and dig myself into a hole.
